    <h1>Minecraft is</h1>
    <p>Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in
        the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May
        2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking
        over development. Minecraft is the best-selling video game in history, with over 238 million copies sold and
        nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021 and has been ported to several platforms</p>
    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <h3>Steve</h3>
    <img src="./images/steve.webp" alt="Steve">
    <p>Steve is a fictional character from the 2011 video game Minecraft. Created by Swedish video game developer Markus
        "Notch" Persson and introduced in the initial Java-based version of Minecraft which was publicly released on May
        17, 2009, Steve is one of nine default player character skins available for players of contemporary versions of
        Minecraft. Steve lacks an official backstory by the developers of Minecraft as he is intended to be a
        customizable player avatar as opposed to being a predefined character. His feminine counterpart, Alex, was first
        introduced in August 2014 for PC versions of Minecraft, with the other seven first debuting in the Java edition
        of the game in October 2022. Depending on the version of Minecraft, players have a chance of spawning as either
        Steve or Alex when creating a new account.</p>
    <h3>Mobs from Minecraft(some)</h3>
    <h4>Creeper</h4>
    <img src="./images/creeper.webp" alt="Creeper">
    <p>Creeper - Creepers are hostile Mobs that spawn naturally in the Overworld. They are very dangerous, due to their
        ability to explode, damaging the Player or nearby Mobs and destroying any blocks around it.</p>
    <h4>Villager</h4>
    <img src="./images/villager.webp" alt="Villager">
    <p>Villager - Villagers are passive mobs that inhabit villages, work at their professions, breed, and interact with
        each other. Their outfit varies according to their occupation and biome. A player can trade with them using
        emeralds as currency.</p>
    <h4>Ender-Dragon</h4>
    <img src="./images/ender-dragon.webp" alt="Ender-Dragon">
    <p>Ender-Dragon - The ender dragon is a giant flying hostile boss mob found when first entering the End. She is the
        largest naturally spawning mob in the game. She guards access to the end gateways that provide entry to the
        outer end islands in addition to the exit portal that allows return to the Overworld as well as access to the
        end credits of Minecraft. Her attacks involve charging at the player and her one-of-a-kind dragon acid attacks.
